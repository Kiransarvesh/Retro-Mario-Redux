# Jumping Game

This project is a simple web-based jumping game inspired by classic endless runner games. The player controls a character who runs and jumps over obstacles to avoid collisions. The game ends when the character collides with an obstacle, and the player can try again to beat their previous score.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Control the character by clicking to jump over obstacles.

- **Game Over Screen**: When the character hits an obstacle, a "Game Over" screen is displayed with the final score and an option to try again.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is playable across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the game.
- **CSS**: Styles the game, with animations for character movement, obstacles, and buttons.

- **Assets**: The game includes custom images and background music to enhance the experience.
